This the question I got in codedex, to solve checkpoint challenge in beginner course.
In your HelloWorld.java file, you'll be creating a Pet simulator! You'll have statistics for your pet that will change based on which actions you take.
Choose up to three (3) statistics that your pet sim will have from the chart above (or create your own), with all three starting at 10.
Create three (3) commands for action, such as p for play, e for eat, and so on, matching your three statistics.
For example, if p is played, your pet's hunger and energy go down by 2, and your social goes down by 1. If e is played, your energy goes down by 1, and if your hunger is below 5, your hunger goes up by 2.
Feel free to create a narrative to go with your pet sim, and add any commands you would like to create more interactivity. ASCII art is encouraged!
